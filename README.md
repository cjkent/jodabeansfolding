Joda Beans Folding Plugin
=========================

Plugin for IntelliJ IDEA which folds code generated by [Joda Beans](http://www.joda.org/joda-beans/).

It creates a fold region starting on a line containing `AUTOGENERATED START` and ending on a line containing
`AUTOGENERATED END`.

It's been tested with IntelliJ 12, 13 and 14.

In IntelliJ 14 it's possible to collapse the generated code by default by selecting the following option
in the settings:

Editor -> Code Folding -> Collapse by default: Custom folding regions

Installation
------------
The plugin isn't available in the main IntelliJ repository and must be installed manually. Download
[the jar](https://github.com/cjkent/jodabeansfolding/blob/master/jodabeansfolding.jar?raw=true) from Github and
choose "Install plugin from disk" from the plugins section of the settings dialog.

You might have to close and reopen the files in your editor the first time you restart after installing the plugin
in order for it to automatically fold the generated code.
