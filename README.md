Joda Beans Folding Plugin
=========================

Plugin for IntelliJ IDEA which folds code generated by [Joda Beans](http://www.joda.org/joda-beans/).

It creates a fold region starting on a line containing `AUTOGENERATED START` and ending on a line containing
`AUTOGENERATED END`.

It's been tested with IntelliJ 12, 13, 14, 15, 2016.*, 2017.*., 2018.*, 2019.1, 2019.2

In IntelliJ 14 and later it's possible to collapse the generated code by default by selecting the following option
in the settings:

Editor -> Code Folding -> Collapse by default: Custom folding regions

Installation
------------
The plugin is available in the IntelliJ plugin repository and can be installed from the Plugins section of the 
Preferences dialog.

It can also be installed manually, To perform a manual installation, download [the jar]
(https://github.com/cjkent/jodabeansfolding/blob/master/jodabeansfolding.jar?raw=true)
from Github and choose "Install plugin from disk" from the plugins section of the preferences dialog.

You might have to close and reopen the files in your editor the first time you restart after installing the plugin
in order for it to automatically fold the generated code.
